<h1>Foodiegraph App Tutorial (Original Proposal)</h1>
<ul>
    <li style="--accent-color:#41516C">
        <div class="date">Step 1</div>
        <div class="title">Upload</div>
        <div class="descr">The main function of our app includes uploading the picture of 
        your available ingredients (or choice bars). The app can then search on the web to 
        retrieve verified recipes containing these foods, filters containing choices “my 
        materials only” and “my materials+”.</div>
    </li>
    <li style="--accent-color:#FBCA3E">
        <div class="date">Step 2</div>
        <div class="title">My Materials Filter</div>
        <div class="descr">If the user chooses “my materials only” choice, then the app 
        would only explore recipes using only the materials selected previously or uploaded. 
        If the user chooses “my materials+” choice then the app would automatically search 
        for results including but not restricted to the ingredients that were previously 
        selected or uploaded.</div>
    </li>
    <li style="--accent-color:#E24A68">
        <div class="date">Step 3</div>
        <div class="title">Flashcards</div>
        <div class="descr">All our recipes come in easy bits fed to users via flashcards. 
        With the recipes chunked down into different slides, users could have a better time 
        digesting the instructions and knowledge each step explicitly better and easier. 
        Demonstration pictures would be included on each slide. Users can mark a recipe as 
        one’s favorite and/or add to one’s library. The annotation feature would be available 
        for users to mark on the recipes freely, including but not limiting to the purpose 
        of noting where to pay extra attention and how to control the fire intensity.</div>
    </li>
    <li style="--accent-color:#1B5F8C">
        <div class="date">Step 4</div>
        <div class="title">Customization</div>
        <div class="descr">There are also secondary functions to aid the users through their 
        journey of exploring their cooking choices. Some of them include the timer function, 
        which would provide a timer, like it is named. The users could use the timer to get 
        the right time and not overcook the food by accident. The stores collaboration feature 
        is a map feature that includes a list and/or updates of local supermarkets and places 
        to get materials. The “My Recipe” function can provide variations of the food recipe 
        and perhaps even upload one’s own in one’s library swiftly via the form of flashcards. 
        The friend feature of our app also enables the sharing of customized recipes! If one 
        wants to taste the food of one’s home country in foreign lands, this app provides a 
        “Search By Nation” function that enlists foods of different origins.</div>
    </li>
    <li style="--accent-color:#4CADAD">
        <div class="date">Step 5</div>
        <div class="title">Your Preferences</div>
        <div class="descr">Moreover, our search engine would be AI-based and would adapt to 
        the styles of cuisine to sort out different sections that one might possibly like. 
        By collecting the data of the user’s saved and favorite recipes, the app would be 
        able to put what might be the most relevant to the user’s preferences into the 
        “recommended” part.</div>
    </li>
    <li style="--accent-color:#41516C">
        <div class="date">Step 6</div>
        <div class="title">Contribute</div>
        <div class="descr">In addition, users are welcome to be a contributor to the app 
        by uploading original recipes. Our app will include a separate section for users 
        to share their own recipes and culinary tips. Users can also draw inspiration from 
        contents uploaded by other users. This gives users access to various cooking techniques 
        and recipes for unique cuisine choices of different countries.</div>
